Rhino plug-in creating an extrusion from a geometry line, and the possibility to change the extrusion via userText panel.

Problems:

1. inside ```private void OnModifyObjectAttributes``` I use the ```RuntimeSerialNumber``` to exclude the element that is not selected, 
to avoid that every geometry into the document changes the userText values, 
is this the correct way? Or should I use ```this.IsSelected()```?

2. if I pick a grip and move it, my extrusion disappears. 
I put into ```public void OnBeforeTransformObjects``` the logic to catch the variation of the grip and change the point location, 
but after this event, the ```OnDraw``` method is not fired.

3. I noticed that if I create geometries and deleted some of them the events still catch the geometries deleted and operate on them, 
also the ```OnDraw``` is called, how I can dispose of the deleted geometries from the memory?

4. The plug-in as to be loaded al the time, when I re-open rhino.
